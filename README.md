floor plan in order to plan the location(s) of the Wi-Fi access point(s) accordingly.
It provides 2 algorithms to find the optimal and the full coverage locations in
the corresponding floor plan. It also provides features like plotting the heat map
of the wireless signals and view the estimated received signal strength at a selected
location.
